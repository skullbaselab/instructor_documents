## During an Assessment
When you are ready to take an assessment there are a couple of things you should do:


1. **Download** the zipped assessment through progress tracker

2. **Unzip** it to get the assessment folder

3. **Rename** the folder to `firstname_lastname_num`. For example, I would rename my second assessment folder `john_doe_2`

4. **Run Mocha** inside the assessment folder to check if it is working. You can use mocha to periodically test whether or not you are passing the assessment (just like cookieMonster!)

6. **Submit** your entire assessment to your designated google drive folder (guide about submitting below)

## After an Assessment

**You will submit assessments and receive assessment feedback through a google drive folder that we will provide.** Talk to your instructor with if you do not have an invite to this folder.

You will receive an invitation to a google drive folder titled `bpl_firstname_lastname`. Inside this folder you will find numbered subfolders: `assessment_1`, `assessment_2`, etc..

### Submitting Assessments

[Video Guide](https://vimeo.com/202451951) (password: **go_bootcamp_go**)

When you are ready to hand over an assessment, upload it to the appropriate folder. To do this, enter the correct numbered folder, hit **new > folder upload**, select your assessment folder. If you are not on chrome, you will have to zip your assessment folder first, and then upload that zipped file. Be sure to upload the *entire* folder.
+ Name your submission folder: `firstname_lastname_num`
  + For example, I would name my 2nd assessment: `john_doe_2`

### Submitting Corrections
Students are required to submit 100% working assessment corrections after an assessment. Upload your entire corrections folder to the appropriate folder (i.e. corrections for first assessment go in assessment_1). When you do corrections be sure to upload a corrected copy of the assessment. Do not modify your original assessment submission.
+ Name your corrections folder: `firstname_lastname_num_corrected`

### Receiving Feedback
For Monday assessments, after your prep instructor has has read through your assessment submission, you will find a commented version of your assessment folder in that folder. Feel free to download and open in Atom to view.
+ Your feedback will be named: `firstname_lastname_num_feedback`
