# Student Evaluations

Bootcamp Prep serves a dual purpose for App Academy, both as an
admissions pipeline and as a standalone product.

The normal admissions process for App Academy involves technical
interviews over video chat (Bootcamp Prep is no exception), but when we
interview an applicant, we only see a single moment in time. It's
possible that this snapshot is skewed, and there are things you simply
can't measure from one moment in time.

Bootcamp Prep affords us an incredible opportunity to go beyond that
snapshot and see candidates in motion. We can observe how they work, how
they learn, how they pair, and many other details that are invisible in
the normal application process.

These evaluations are often the _most critical_ piece of information we
have about an applicant, so please be thorough. Even if they do not pass
the assessment, they are still in our application system and many of
them continue to pursue us. For this reason, _every_ applicant who goes
through JumpStart should be evaluated, regardless of whether they passed
the assessment.

## Logistics

### When are evaluations done?

The instructor and/or TA should complete the evaluations after the
students graduate so that you can reflect over their whole time in
class. Try to get them done during the interim between classes.

Bootcamp Prep students will sign up for an interview, and we will need
your evaluation to make an admissions decision from there.

Note that we will judge their current technical capabilities based on
the interview and not on the evaluation, but also remember that we're as
interested in trajectory as we are in current capabilities, so these
evaluations are important.

### Where do I record evaluations?

Record your evaluations in the [Evaluations
Spreadsheet][evaluations-spreadsheet] (request edit access if you do not
already have it). The students' names and IDs should be pre-filled. Find
the tab for the your class. Once you have finished filling them in (or
if the tab doesn't exist yet), contact [Jon Wolverton][jon-mail].

## Instructions

### Info Fields

These are mostly self-explanatory, and most of them should be
pre-filled.

##### ID

This is the student's ID in our system. This should be pre-filled, but
you'll need to copy it to create a second evaluation for a student.

##### First Name

##### Last Name

##### Evaluator's Full Name

This should be your full name. If the student never showed up, leave
this blank (along with all the other fields) and just say they never
showed up in the [Other Comments](#other-comments) section.

### Ratings

These are not measures of the student's abilities, at least not
directly. What you should be rating is your _confidence_ that the
student will be successful in our full-time immersive course. The rating
should go as follows:

1. I'm confident this student will _not_ succeed.
2. This student will probably _not_ succeed.
3. I'm not sure either way.
4. This student will probably succeed.
5. I'm confident this student will succeed.

Each of these ratings has a comment field to explain why you gave the
rating you did. This is _at least as important_ as the rating field, so
do not leave it blank.

If you have no information on any or all of these (e.g. if the student
never showed up), please _leave them blank_.

##### Pair Rating / Comments
##### Work Ethic Rating / Comments
##### Coder Rating / Comments

### Other Fields

##### Other Comments

This field is for any observations that don't fit into the ratings
rubric. You should consider everything that is involved in success at
App Academy, which includes learning, pairing, finding a job, and many
other things.

This can be a general summary or a description of specific events.
Anything you believe could be an indicator of their fit for App Academy.
If you marked the [Flag for Review](#flag-for-review) field, please
explain why here.

##### Flag for Review

If there is any reason you think they may be unsuccessful and it isn't
obvious from your ratings, please mark this field as `"FLAG"` and
explain in the [Other Comments](#other-comments) field.

##### Transferred

You should not fill in this field. It is used when transferring
evaluations to our main system to make sure that evaluations don't get
transferred twice.

The only reason you should worry about this is if you need to modify
evaluations you've already made and this field has already been marked
`"TRUE"`. If that's the case, contact [Jon Wolverton][jon-mail] again,
and let him know what needs to be changed.
