# Helpful Teaching Techniques*

### Help students achieve a Growth Mindset
- Acknowledge that learning how to program is very hard
- There's a steep learning curve and that it's hard for everyone
- Remind them that learning a programming language is like learning a spoken langue--which is hard
- Emphasize that challenge is learning and that their struggle is a sign that they are learning

### Remind them of everyone's purpose for being here
- Your purpose is to help them grow, not to expose their flaws
- Most importantly, they are here to learn for themselves and ultimately, get into a top bootcamp

### When Students Apologize
- Does it mean they feel dumb?
- Don't accept their apology
- Remind them of their purpose for being here
- Remind them that there are no dumb questions when it comes to their learning

### Reward Them
- Constantly
- For little nuggets, if necessary
- Feedback sandwich (good thing, bad thing, good thing)

### Interacting with Shy Students
- Direct questions specifically and alternately
- Have shy partner drive, have other partner describe, have shy partner recap

### Use Different Modalities
- Draw it out
- Have them type it
- Have them explain it

### Let Them Take the Wheel
- Resist the force of typing
- Ask permission to use the keyboard/mouse
- When taking the wheel
  - Navigating their codebase
  - Demonstrating a concept
  - If they ask about a shortcut, immediately have them try it themselves
  - TODO comments
    - (cmd+shift+F)
    - Good way to remember which parts they had questions on
    - Good way to speed up code reviews

### Debugging Techniques
- Debug with them versus giving them the answer
- As soon as you realize they’re on the wrong path ask yourself how you knew, then ask pointed questions to help them come to the same realization
- Let them go a little ways and then debrief them on what they did wrong
- All Else Fails, Refactor
  - Can’t find object in dirty house… clean house, object appears!

### Ask Open-Ended Questions
- What else from today can I explain?
- What else from the material can I help explain?
- Why did you make this decision?
- Why/when is this code run?
- How can I explain this better?
- Talk me through the process (ie. auth pattern, react)
- What is X for?
- What is the purpose of X?
- What would happen if you didn’t have X?
- Feel free to backtrack if you start asking a “bad” question
- Remember, there are no dumb questions

### Ending the Interaction
- What else from today can I explain?
- What if they don't know what to ask?
- Have a list of common sticking-points for each day
- Have them recap what you talked about
- Affirm them as you walk away

*at the end of the day, remember that students are individuals and these techniques might not work for everyone
