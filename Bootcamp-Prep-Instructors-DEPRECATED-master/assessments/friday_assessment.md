### Uploading Solution Videos
Except for the last assessment, you must share solution videos to all of the Friday assessments so students can study them over the weekend.

Links to the assessment's solutions videos can be found in our Bootcamp-Prep-Assessments [repo](https://github.com/appacademy/Bootcamp-Prep-Assessments).

  * [w3d5](https://github.com/appacademy/Bootcamp-Prep-Assessments/blob/master/w3d5/README.md)

Edit the corresponding README's in our Github repo to include the links and password to the assessment's solutions videos immediately after class. Don't forget to push your changes.

### Submitting a Perfect Assessment
Students must email you a perfect assessment before class on Monday. This encourages them to watch our solution videos and study the week's material over the weekend.

You do not have to score these assessments. However, if a student fails to email you, he/she earns a strike.
