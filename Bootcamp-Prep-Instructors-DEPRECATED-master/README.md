Welcome to the Bootcamp Prep instructional team! Each cycle, our goal is to maximize the number of graduating students who are ready and capable to apply to recognized coding bootcamps. Many of our students start Bootcamp Prep with little to no programming experience, while others have studied programming, applied to bootcamps and have been rejected. Your task is not an easy one. We succeed only to the extent that we are able to provide our students with an intense and effective educational program. You are an absolutely critical part of that program. The purpose of this guide is to outline your primary duties and give some guidance on how to perform them effectively.

## Daily Instruction

### 30 minutes before and after

The main instruction occurs between 6:30pm - 8:30pm. However, class time is from 6:00pm - 9:00pm. So what should you do with the extra 30 minutes before and after the min instruction? The first 30 minutes of class should be spent doing a deep dive into the homework and clarifying questions fromthe previous day. This will look like a focused, guided Q+A session. If no one asks any questions about the homework, then you should still go over it and make sure they understand every line of code that's written. The last 30 minutes of class is more free form. This is the time for open questions about anything related to the course, or just extra time for students to tackle the problem set. This will look like an open, free-form Q+A session.

Initially, these will be optional. But if a student fails two assessments (less than 50% of spec passing) OR get a 0% on any assessment, they MUST come to these sessions and the risk of being marked absent.

### Lecturing

Each session, you have the responsibility of lecturing to students. The topics of a particular day's lecture can be found in the lecture notes for that day in the course [repo][repo]. Class opens with a lecture and students are expected to work on the day's problem set with whatever remaining time there is. Lectures can range from 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on the day's materials.

While you should stick to the lecture notes as closely as possible, you should feel free cater your lectures for the needs of your students. We have also compiled [instructor notes][instructor_notes] that contain day-by-day tips. **You must look** at these while teaching your first course with us. In addition to tips, they also list common questions that occur and outline the topics students must grasp by the end of that lecture.

### Being a Good Instructor

**As an instructor, you are responsible for the success of your students.** This is an enormous responsibility and one that we do not give you lightly. You have been selected not only for your technical skills, but also for your ability to teach and take on this responsibility. **It is more important to be empathetic, invested, and honest** than it is to be an expert at JavaScript as an instructor of Bootcamp Prep.

#### Answering Questions
Especially early on in the course, **do not sit and wait for students to ask you questions**; actively engage them on whatever they're working on and have them walk you through their code and thought process. Students will often feel like they have no questions or they are too scared to ask a question; **if you wait for questions you will have nothing to do**. In the past, we've noticed that students quickly fall behind in the first week if you do not address this issue and fail to engage them.

What we've reminded students in the past before is that being scared or lost in class is very normal. In addition, they should feel challenged because this is a very challenging course. There is a learning curve when learning a programming language, just like there's a learning when learning a spoken language.

### Reviewing Students' Code

**The most valuable thing you can do as an instructor is to talk with the students about their code**. When a student is in the midst of an issue, trying to debug their code, you have a unique opportunity to help them cope with an applied problem that is directly in front of them. The advice you give them will be something they can immediately apply, which means they have a chance of actually retaining it. It's their opportunity to slow you down and make sure they actually understand what you are telling them. Students often tune out when they lose the thread of a lecture; this is their opportunity to learn a concept deeply.

You should periodically sit down and do a code review/check in with each student while they work through the problem set. Code reviews are a great opportunity to make sure that students aren't just brute forcing their way through the project or writing tons of code that is wrong because they didn't think to test it in their rush to complete the day's work.

Every time you sit down with a student, there is **something** important that they can learn and take away from the experience. It is your job to find out what that is and help them learn it. Sometimes it's a concept they were able to code, but didn't understand; sometimes it's a deeper understanding of how Javascript works; sometimes it's helpful debugging strategies; and sometimes it's just that coding is hard and everyone makes mistakes and it's okay.

Your primary strategy when working with students should be to **use questions** to probe and find out what they can learn and then help them learn it.

Having a perspective that your job is to find areas of growth in your students and nurture those areas as opposed to having a perspective that your job is to be a human debugger will make your job significantly more enjoyable and rewarding and it will ultimately benefit the students tremendously.

## Assessments

Over the course of Bootcamp Prep, there are a total of seven assessments. Assessments occur every Monday and Friday except for the first Monday. Details on proctoring, and grading assessments can be found [here](./assessments).

Students are expected to struggle through Friday assessments. Passing 0 specs on Fridays is very much the norm. We want to stress that especially if they are feeling bad about their poor test scores on Fridays. They just need more time with the material and to study through the weekend. Their goal should be to do better and demonstrate progress on the following Monday's assessment. If students are passing only 1 or 2 specs on Mondays, they might be struggling and you should reach out to these students.

## Evaluations

At the end of the course, you will evaluate each student according to
[these guidelines](./evaluations.md). This information is instrumental
in our admissions process.

## Teaching Techniques

Use these [teaching techniques][teaching-techniques]! There is a lot of dense
information in that document. When you are first learning how to be an effective instructor, you should consult that document after each student interaction and find something you could have done better. This is just as important to doing a good job than improving your technical skills if not more so.

[teaching-techniques]: ./teaching-techniques.md

+ **Set high standards for yourself and the students.** Most of the
students are new to software, and they don't know what good code looks
like. They should be held to the standard of a professional, or else
they will never get there; it is never too early in the course to
*demand* this of them.

+ **Start enforcing style guidelines on the first day**.
Give honest feedback and make it clear that you believe they can meet the
standards you set. And then help them meet those standards.

  Never let students push off styling their code properly. Do not let them put off fixing poor variable naming, convoluted logic, bad code style, etc.
  That stuff is hard for them because they are bad at it; if you don't
  force them to do it now they never will get good at it. It's alright
  if they hack together a solution at first, but it's your job to make
  sure they turn their hack into high-quality code.

+ Many students will be focused solely on finishing the exercise that
they are working on, without any care as to code quality. It bears
repeating to students: **any software engineer worth their salt can
make a solution work. The mark of a great software engineer is high
quality code.**

+ **Do not ever just give the student an answer**; help them figure out what
they needed to know to get to the answer. When they run into a bug,
spend time asking them how their code works.

  The best way to answer questions is to ask more questions yourself. A
  common technique is to pull up the Node REPL or a pad of paper
  and have them work through explanatory examples. Do anything except
  give them a recipe for solving their current bug or problem.

+ A final note: **students appreciate your honesty**. They want to
understand things deeply. They like it when you spend time struggling
with them. Don't be afraid to admit when you don't know something. Either tell them it's beyond the scope of the course and/or follow-up on Piazza or the next day with an answer. **Honest feedback is essential and valued**.

### Helping the Weaker Students

We need to keep a close pulse on the progress of each student and ensure that we target our efforts over the course of the class to those areas and to those students that need and can benefit from it most.

Students break down into four categories:

* Students who could show up every day and get into the best bootcamps without our help.
* Students who are strong but need to be occasionally unstuck.
* Students who will struggle through the class, but will improve because they ask questions.
* Students who will struggle through the class and hardly improve because they **won't** ask questions or study outside of class.

Our goal is to get as many people into bootcamps as possible after the class;
therefore, **let the best students be**. Do not overly focus on them because they are the easiest to work with, or because you can do cooler stuff with them. **Your job is to save people who are on the
edge**.

It is important to **identify the weaker students**; they need your
help. Focus on them. Roughly 2/3's of your time should be spent with
the weaker students. The assessment scores can be super helpful in keeping
a pulse on the class.

## Piazza
One of the tools we use to help our students outside of class time is [Piazza](https://piazza.com/).

It's a Q&A web service. It can be best described as a mixture between a wiki and a forum. Users can publicly and anonymously ask questions, answer questions, and post notes. Each question prompts a collective answer to which any user (students and instructors alike) can contribute. It also supports code snippets and styling.

Part of your role as an instructor will be to encourage students to ask questions on Piazza, and to answer these questions. Details on how we use Piazza for Bootcamp Prep can be found [here](./piazza.md).

## Enforcing Rules/Strikes

We employ a strike system for Bootcamp Prep.

If a student receives for than four strikes, they loose their guarantee. Although we expect students to be responsible and self-motivated, the system exist as a necessary evil to make sure students are doing everything they need to do to learn. Refer to the [course rules][course-rules] document for details on the rules and their enforcement. If you're ever in doubt about a rule or its enforcement,
email your supervisor.

[course-rules]: https://github.com/appacademy/Bootcamp-Prep-Curriculum/blob/master/other/agreement_summaries.md

## Contributing to the Curriculum

The curriculum has evolved, improved, and stabilized quite a bit, but
there is still room for improvement. We expect you to
actively contribute ideas to its improvement. Keep track of what
students struggle with and what you think would be particularly
helpful to them.

**The curriculum is not Gospel**. It is not infallible; you will find
lots of things you can do better. In some places, it's just plain
incomplete (and maybe even, Heaven forbid, wrong).

**Editing the curriculum on GitHub**; If you spot something that needs to be changed in the curriculum, please make a pull request and assign your supervisor. We aren't going to allow direct pushes to the master branch because several other instructors will be referencing the curriculum and we want to have a structured way for informing them of any curriculum changes.

## Feedback and Performance

### Student Feedback
Every week students fill out reports through a google form. One of the fields asks them to rate the their instructor's performance for the week and give them "kudos" for something they did will and "feedback" for something they can improve. This information is important because it gives direct information about the quality of our work - not all jobs have that luxury.

This feedback will reach you in two ways:
* You will get a digest of a limited subset of your feedbacks to give you a pulse on how students feel about their interactions with you.
* You will also discuss student feedback as well as overall performance at your regular one-on-ons with your supervisor. This will be an opportunity for us to help you contextualize and analyze your feedback to find strategies for improvement, as well as point out things you are consistently excelling at.

### Sensitivity

The students that attend our program come from a multitude of different
backgrounds and have values that could be completely different from
yours. This fact is essential to acknowledge and be mindful of.

As an instructor in such an environment the onus is upon you to be extra
sensitive. It is not your job to judge the students and determine if
their threshold for offense is valid or not. Instead take great care to
treat all of our students with great respect, as you would want to be
treated yourself.

I will now share an anecdote to help illustrate this point:

While giving a lecture the instructor was making a coding demo where the
subject was a space ship that, at the class's suggestion, was called
'The Turkey'. Its various cargo bays and ports were, again at the
suggestions of the class, named in reference to turkey parts
traditionally eaten i.e. 'Cavity', 'Drumstick'.

One student in the class was disgusted and offended to the point that
they had to leave the lecture. The student had a background in animal
rights/liberation and had worked specifically with turkeys. The student
found the idea of eating a turkey as abhorrent as eating a human and to
hear the lecturer and entire class laughing about it was horrifying to
them.

Many would hear this anecdote and think: "Most people eat Turkeys,
what's the big deal, the student should just get over it". This is not
the mindset you should adopt. Instead acknowledge that their background
is different from yours. If this topic offends the student it is not for
you to decide whether it is valid or not for the student to be offended,
instead your duty is to be sensitive to the student and avoid the topic.

It goes without saying, of course, but your sensitivity must extend to
issues of gender, sexuality, politics, animal rights, etc. We are a
completely inclusive program and we should strive to treat all of our
students with respect.

## Nitty-Gritty Tips

### Allow your Lectures to be Flexible

You will get questions in lectures that go off topic. It's completely fine to indulge such questions as long as you do it in a way where everyone in class can understand the answer. If you notice several people in the class are struggling with a specific topic, you can use examples in your lecture that will exercise their understanding of that topic. You should begin every lecture with a free form Q+A where students can ask *any* questions they want. As long as you hit the key points outlined in the instructor notes, please personalize your lecture in a way that's best for the students.

### Live Coding and White Boarding (No Slides)

Bootcamp Prep does not use slides. Slides are too static for the dynamic lectures we expect you to give. It is **vital** that your lecture should have several moments where the students are actually typing out code (aka "I want everyone to try typing this"). Attaining that coding muscle memory in their fingers will be far more valuable than listening to you talk or looking at a picture of some code.

White boarding is another great option you have at your disposal. We prefer white boards because students will be able to follow the thread of your explanation better than they would if they were confronted with a large pre-written block of code.

You should also live code for your students as often as possible. When you make mistakes (and you will), never ignore it. Point out that you made a mistake. Show the students your debugging process. Show them how they could (1) identify this bug if they run into it and (2) how they can go about debugging it. It also let's the students know that we *all* make bugs in our code. The good programmers are the ones who can find and fix those bugs.

### Don't Give Them the Answer!

It's here twice because it's important. Don't just give them the
answer. Have them struggle for the answer (but guide them towards
it with good questions). Giving them the answer right away or simply
telling them better ways of doing things isn't as effective as having
them struggle and understand **why**.

When they're having problems, get conceptual. Bug fixing isn't
terribly helpful in the long term. *Teach a person to fish*...

### Take notes

Keep notes on who struggled with what. Note things you want to cover
in the next day's lecture/Q+A.

### Summary

* Actively engage students throughout the day; press them.
* Don't just fix bugs; get conceptual.
* Track things you may want to cover in lecture.
* Cater your lecture for your students
* Your lectures should be as interactive as possible; no slides!
