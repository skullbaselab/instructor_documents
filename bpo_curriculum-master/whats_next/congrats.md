## Congrats!

Congratulations Bootcamp Prep graduate! You've worked really hard
over these last few weeks. Give yourself a pat on the back. However, remember that
this is only the beginning of your programming career. You still have your Bootcamp
interviews ahead of you. So be sure to bring your A-game.

If you are confident in your ability to solve the problems we have covered in
Bootcamp Prep, we have no doubts that you will succeed!


*"Keep Coding"*
