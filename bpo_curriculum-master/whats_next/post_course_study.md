## Post-Course Study

Wait! Just because we have reached the end of our 4 weeks does not mean you should
immediately schedule all of your bootcamp interviews. Before you start scheduling
interviews for your top bootcamp choices, ask yourself if you *feel* confident in
your abilities. **Treat your application as your one shot to gain acceptance into these
bootcamps.** If your application is rejected from a Bootcamp, you may
not be able to reapply to it in the future, so take these opportunities seriously!

We recommend you take some time to go back through our curriculum and
redo all of the materials and problems from the problem sets and assessments. Anything we learned
in Bootcamp Prep is fair game for an interview (especially an a/A interview!).
Be honest with yourself, if you are not feeling 100% comfortable will a problem or
topic, go back and review it.

We recommend that you go back and keep studying any problems you don't feel 100%
comfortable with. Bootcamp Prep is fundamentally about using programming to
solve problems. The goal is that by the end of the course you have the skills to
solve relatively complex problems and explore new topics on your own.

A good way to gauge if you've met this goal is to try and successfully solve each of the problems
presented in the course (on problem sets, assessments, etc.). Do them without looking at the
solutions. Then do them timed. How'd you do?

If you didn't do well and/or are not feeling very confident, then remember, practice makes
perfect!

As you keep studying do problems without running/testing the code until you are done. Can you
walk through your code as the interpreter correctly? Can you tell if your code will work without
running it? This is what applicants who rock their technical interviews are usually able to do.


A good way to check if you are ready is to redo all the problems in the course,
but *make it harder* for yourself this time around. Train hard so your interview is
easy! Use the following steps:

**Time yourself.** Give yourself a maximum of 15 minutes to work on any problem.
You will probably complete the easier problems in the course well below this time.
15 minutes per question is the amount of time you will be allotted for each question
on the App Academy technical interview.

**Write the code without running it until the very end.** Only run the code when
the time is up. This will test your ability to understand how code will evaluate
and foresee any bugs or errors. On some bootcamp interviews, like App Academy,
you will not be allowed to check your code by running it.

**Explain your code.** After coming up with a solution to a problem, try explaining
your solution aloud. Remember that a huge part of a bootcamp interview is explaining
your thoughts!

### When you're feeling ready...

If you're feeling good, then give yourself a pat on the back. You've worked really hard and
have learned a lot. Give yourself credit for that! Then take a look at the list below.

A good strategy is to apply to *every* bootcamp in the city(s) you are considering.
Even if you are dead-set on attending one particular coding bootcamp, going through
multiple application processes will make for invaluable practice. Each application will
force you to practice problem solving using programming, write code in a high-stress and timed
environment, talk about your solution and sell yourself as an applicant.
Start by applying to bootcamps that you are not terribly interested in or with less challenging
application processes, and move your way up. Take every coding challenge and technical interview
you receive seriously--remember, it's *invaluable practice*. Schedule technical interviews with
bootcamps that you are dying to get into only when you truly feel ready.

## Resources Outside of App Academy Bootcamp Prep

As you probably already know, there are many other Bootcamp Prep courses available.
For example, Hack Reactor, FullStack, Flatiron have their own free Bootcamp Prep
courses or practice problems available. Take advantage of these. In each Bootcamp's
respective prep program, you may find specialty topics that may pop up on their interviews.
For example, if you are interested in interviewing for Hack Reactor, be sure to
spend time with their prep. Likewise, if you are interested in FullStack,
check out their prep!

### Applying to App Academy

- **If you have not applied to a/A before:**

[Apply][app_academy_app] normally and then App Academy will send you an email with a link to prep work and a link to schedule your technical interview. When applying, please use the same email you used to enroll in Bootcamp Prep.

- **If you have applied to a/A already:**

App Academy will send you an email after you've completed the course with a link to prep work and a link to schedule your technical interview.

In either case, you will have an expedited process, skipping the initial coding
challenges.

Best of luck on your interviews prep graduate. Remember your training!
