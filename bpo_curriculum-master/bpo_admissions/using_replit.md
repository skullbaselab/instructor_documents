### What is Repl.it?

[Repl.it][repl.it] is the platform we will be using in Bootcamp Prep Online to
write and run our JavaScript code. REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop. When
we enter code in the REPL (the black box in repl.it), our line of code will be read,
evaluated according to the rules of JavaScript, the result will be printed, and
then this process will occur again (loop)!
