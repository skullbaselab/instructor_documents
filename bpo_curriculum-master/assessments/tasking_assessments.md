## Taking an Assessment

When you are ready to take an assessment there are a couple of things you should do:

- Download the zipped assessment through our course page
- Unzip it to get the assessment folder
- Rename the folder to firstname_lastname_2. For example, I would rename my second assessment folder alvin_zablan_2
- Run Mocha inside the assessment folder to check if it is working. You can use mocha to periodically test whether or not you are passing the assessment (just like cookieMonster!)
- Time Yourself for 1 Hour; these assessments are designed to be completed within this timeframe. When time is up, upload your code as is. Be honest with yourself, so our team can provide you with the most accurate feedback and tips possible. Avoid using notes and other resources as you work. After you submit the assessment, feel free to continue working on it. However, make sure you send it in at the hour mark.
- Submit your entire assessment to your designated google drive folder (guide about submitting below)
- Email bpo@appacademy.io and let us know when your assessment submission has been uploaded and you are ready to receive feedback. Be sure to mention your name and assessment number.

## After an Assessment

You will submit assessments and receive assessment feedback through a google drive folder that we will provide. Email us at bpo@appacademy.io with the subject line 'firstname lastname google drive' if you have not yet received an invite to this folder (be sure to check your inbox).

You will receive an invitation to a google drive folder titled bpo_firstname_lastname. Inside this folder you will find numbered subfolders: assessment_1, assessment_2, etc..

## Submitting Assessments

When you are ready to hand over an assessment, upload it to the appropriate folder. To do this, enter the correct numbered folder, hit new > folder upload, select your assessment folder. Be sure to upload the entire folder.
