### Node

Node.js is a very powerful runtime environment built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites, robots, and other general purpose applications. What this really means for us is that Node provides a way for us to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

### Download Node

In order to get started with Node, go to https://nodejs.org/ and download the most stable version for your operating machine.

Once you have it successfully installed, try typing `node -v` in your Terminal/Command Prompt. (Terminal for Macs and Command Prompt for PCs). This should return your node version. 

Congrats, youâ€™ve successfully installed Node!
