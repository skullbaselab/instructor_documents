## Taking Assessments

Assessments in Bootcamp Prep will be taken in a different environment from problem
sets. That is, on an assessment, you will writing/running code on your computer
and not on repl.it.

Assessments will give you a taste of how programmers write code in the real world!

To take an assessment you will need a couple of things installed:
[Node.js][node], [Mocha][mocha], and [Atom][atom]

The next few sections will guide you through what these are and how to install.
