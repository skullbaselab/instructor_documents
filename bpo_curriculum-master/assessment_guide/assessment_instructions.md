## Assessment Instructions

*"The exam will not be open book, but it will be open mind."*

-Dr. Christina Zamfirescu

Almost time for an assessment! Remember that assessments in Bootcamp Prep are just practice. It
is okay to not do so hot on them. How you perform on these assessments will have no impact
on your admission decision into App Academy. We recommend you avoid referring to previous notes or videos as
you work through the assessment so our TAs can give you accurate tips and feedback on the code you produce.
Time yourself for 1 hour 15 minutes and take it like a test. You're inevitably going to be nervous on your
bootcamp interviews. It's beneficial to work out the nerves of coding in a high stress environment now.

You'll notice that assessments are preceded by practice assessments. The practice assessment will prime
you for the following "real" assessment, so study the practice thoroughly! You are only required
to submit the assessments for feedback, not the practice assessments.

**It is important that you follow these instructions whenever taking an assessment
in order to get feedback as soon as possible. Be sure to scroll down through the videos we have
below on how to set up an assessment.**

* Make sure you are feeling confident in your ability to code the previous problems
before hopping into an assessment

* Download the assessment

* Unzip/uncompress the assessment folder

* Using your command line (Terminal/Command Prompt), enter the assessment folder using the `cd`
command.

* In your command line, run `mocha`. This will run the test cases on your assessment.
If you scroll up toward the top of the output, you will see a quick breakdown of what
specs were passed. You can test with `mocha` as many times as you please.

* Open up the assessment folder in Atom. The problems you need to solve are in
the `.js` files in the `problems` folder.

* Only write your code to the `.js` files in the `problems` folder.
Do not move or edit any of the files in the assessment folder.

* Try your best to take the assessment without looking at notes and time yourself
for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Upload your work when time is up so you can receive accurate feedback. It's okay if you found it tough and didn't finish, you'll be able to study
the solutions once uploading!

* When you are finished or when time is up, rename your assessment folder to
`firstName_lastName_num`. For example assessment 1 should be name `john_doe_1`.

* Zip/compress the entire assessment folder and upload it. Be sure to upload the
**entire** zipped folder.

## After an Assessment

* Once uploaded, you will have access to the solutions. The password is always **go_bootcamp_go** . You should use these solutions
to complete corrections. Study these hard!

* **Wait for feedback on your assessment submission before moving forward** (except for
  the practice assessment). You will be able to download our feedback once it is ready.

* Study these problems and be sure you are able to solve them on your own before moving on.
Make changes based on our feedback. Be honest with yourself. Do not move on to the
next section until you feel confident that you can solve these assessment problems.
Assessments often come in back to back pairs. After learning from your mistakes,
you can expect to improve on the follow up assessment!

**Check out the practice assessment in the next section to get used to the workflow!**
