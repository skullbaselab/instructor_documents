## Slack

While we continue to improve the platform and built-in chat feature,
you may find our Bootcamp Prep Slack Team as an excellent place to live chat with
other students and instructors. The slack team is great because you can chat with students from
both the online as well as live version of bootcamp prep. You have been invited to the slack team
upon enrolling into the class and can access it [here][bootcamp-prep-slack]. We highly
encourage you to download slack on your computer and mobile devices since Slack is the
industry standard when it comes to team communication for software engineers.

Slack supports different channels and private messages. Feel free to message
`@azablan` if you have any questions or concerns about the course.


## Asking Questions with Chat

App Academy Online has a built in chat feature for students to utilize.
Inside the chat you will find different channels. Be sure to keep an eye on the
**BootcampPrep** channel. In this channel you'll be able to chat with all Bootcamp Prep
students and alumni from both the live and online versions. Community chat is awesome
because the entire class will benefit from the questions and answers.

An important aspect of being a top bootcamp candidate is the ability to communicate
and collaborate on technical matters. We'll use chat to this end! If you have a
question, don't hesitate to ask it. Active conversation is important to learning
how to program. By asking questions we can fill gaps in our knowledge. There is
no such thing as a stupid question! Chances are if you have a question about the
material, other students may be wondering the same as well. Be proactive with your education.

On the flip side, if you have insight into another student's question, feel free to
jump in and offer an answer. Explaining code will be a skill tested on your bootcamp
interviews. Ability to explain a concept to someone else shows a deep level of understanding.
Use this as an opportunity to help your fellow programmers and show what you know.
Teaching is a very rewarding experience, trust us :).

### Asking a Question

When chatting about code, it's helpful to illustrate your thoughts with a code block.
In the chat you can create formatted code blocks with syntax highlighting. You have
the option to select the language for syntax highlighting, be sure to set it to **JS**
for JavaScript! Just hit the code icon, type your code snippet, and hit `shift` + `enter`
to send!

Besides code blocks you have options like file uploads, bulleted lists, and emojis!
