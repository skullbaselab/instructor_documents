## Course Guidelines

Before we get started, let's talk about how to get the most out of this course.
Bootcamp Prep is broken up into topics. Topics may consist of:

* video lectures
* supplementary notes
* problem sets
* assessments

As you work through a task, be sure to scroll down completely. There may be more content
on the page. We will be using [repl.it][repl.it] to write and run our JavaScript code during
lectures and problem sets. Assessment code will be written and run on your personal
computer (more info on assessments later in the course)!

### Solution Videos Password

You can use the password **go_bootcamp_go** to access the assessment solution videos.

### Watching Lectures

We highly encourage you to code along with us during the lecture videos.
Be sure to open a JavaScript [repl.it][repl.it] in a tab in your browser and follow along.
A degree of memorization will be required to succeed. But as with anything else in
life, practice makes perfect. Simply watching the lecture will not be enough to make you a great
programmer. Follow along during the lecture and repeat exercises again after.

Whether it's code from lecture videos, problem sets, assessments or solutions, don't
just copy and paste the code. Please don't skip over the work of actually typing out the code.
It will be tough and potentially frustrating in the beginning. You will make a lot of mistakes.
It's really ok. It's a necessary and unavoidable phase to go through. Typing out the code will
give you a muscle memory that simply listening to videos won't give. In order to become a better
programmer, you must program! The majority of the time you spend studying should be spent
on the keyboard.

### Video Playback Speed

We highly recommend you download a video speed controller plugin so you may fast forward through some
videos. We have solution walkthroughs for **every single problem** in the curriculum (that's over 24 hours of
video alone). Feel free to speed up the playback if you find yourself wanting a faster pace.
However, we recommend not skipping any videos completely, as it is important to hear how to explain a
solution in plain English. Check out [Video Speed Controller for Chrome][video-speed-chrome] and
[Video Speed Controller for Firefox][video-speed-firefox], but any similar plugin will do.

### Using Solutions

As you work through the problem sets, don't get discouraged when you look at the
solution and feel like you would have never came up with that code. This is normal.
The most important thing is to understand how the solution works that way you can
utilize that knowledge in the future. Feel free to peek at the solution when you
get stuck!

Before you move on from any problem, you need to make sure that you truly understand
it and can code the solution by yourself. Hold yourself to a high standard. The best case
scenario on a bootcamp interview will be when you are given a problem you have seen before. The
biggest regret you will have is if you are unable to solve this problem because you did not
take the time to study it when you first saw it. Study hard so your interview is easy!

Always check your answers by watching our solution videos and analyzing the code.
You should redo any questions you get wrong. Make sure you are understanding the
concepts in the solution, as well as the format of our solution. Proper style is very
important for preventing bugs. At the very beginning, at least, your final solutions should
look exactly like our solutions in terms of style and indentation.

For any given problem there will be a number of different solutions. Although your code
may differ from our provided solutions, your work may be just as good! Feel free to post
in the chat to get some feedback on your solution. Your solution may differ aesthetically
(different variable naming and usage) or even strategically (different logic). In either case,
you should study every solution you see. There is much to gain by understanding the different
ways we can tackle a single problem. You may even notice that our lecture videos and solution code
may differ aesthetically. Don't let this throw you off! Your job as a programmer is to understand
any code you come across.

### Staying Determined

Learning to programming is hard. It will test your determination! It only takes
a single typo for your code to be completely wrong. This will be frustrating.
Have patience and give yourself time to grow as a programmer. The more time you
spend coding, the more fluent you will become. Try to have fun while you develop
this new skill!
