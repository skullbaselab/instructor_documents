### What is Repl.it?

[Repl.it][repl.it] is the platform we will be using in Bootcamp Prep Online to
write and run much of our JavaScript code. Repl.it is awesome because it runs in your
web browser. By creating a repl.it account you can save your code sessions and
return to them later. That means that you can log into the repl.it website from
any computer and pick up your work right where you left off!

REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop. When we enter code in the REPL (the black box
in repl.it), our line of code will be read, evaluated according to the rules of JavaScript,
the result will be printed, and then this process will occur again (loop)!

### Experiment!

As you watch the lectures, we recommend you have [repl.it][repl.it] open in a tab
to code along with us. Feel free to pause the videos and take a minute to explore ideas
on your own using the repl. Programming is nice because it is easy to experiment and
test any curiosities you have by playing with some code. If things don't pan out,
just delete the code! Not many disciplines offer this level of experimentation, so
take advantage of this.
