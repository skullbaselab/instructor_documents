## Using the AAOnline Platform

Since App Academy Online will be your home as you work through the curriculum, let's
take a tour of the platform so you can take advantage of all of its features!

### Tasks

You will work through the Bootcamp Prep curriculum by completing a series of tasks
on AAOnline. The content of tasks will vary throughout the course. Tasks may be readings,
videos lectures, quizzes, problems, solutions, or assessments. Tasks are
organized into topics. You can flip through topics and tasks in the sidebar:

### Completing Tasks

After reading/watching/solving a task, you should mark it as complete by hitting
the green **Next** button on the bottom bar. As you move through the course, we
highly encourage you complete the tasks in order. The bottom bar will also display your
progress for the current topic:

### Searching Tasks

Sometimes you may wish to go back to a previous Task. You can do this by navigating
through the sidebar or using the search bar. You can enter the name of a topic or even
the name of a problem:

### Profile Page

You can access your profile page by clicking on your user icon in the top right
corner. On your profile page you can track course progress, view any assessment feedback,
and book your tutoring or mock interview sessions:

### Tutoring Sessions

You may book your tutoring sessions through the links in your profile page, using the supplied
voucher codes. Note that each code can be used to book a single session. Feel free
to use your sessions whenever you want reinforce a topic or go over any problems with an
instructor. **Tutoring sessions must be booked in advance, so plan accordingly.**
Tutoring sessions will use [Skype][skype] for video/voice chat and your tutor will give you a shared programming environment. Your tutor will give you a link to the shared workspace when the tutoring session begins.


### Mock Interviews

You can also book your mock interview sessions through your profile page. Note
that mock interviews use a different booking link and different voucher codes from
tutoring sessions. Mock interviews will be administered exactly like a real App Academy
technical interview, except you will receive immediate feedback and tips from your mock
interviewer. Don't worry, your performance on these mocks will have no bearing on your actual
application decision, but they will give you invaluable experience. To make the most of them,
**you should book your mock interview sessions after completing the course as you can
be tested on anything from the curriculum. Mock interviews must be booked in advance,
so plan accordingly.**
