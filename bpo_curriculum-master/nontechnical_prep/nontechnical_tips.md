## Non-Technical Interview Prep

Most Coding Bootcamps will have a non-technical aspect to their selection process. This takes the
form of a non-technical interview in App Academy's application pipeline. After showing promise on
the technical interview, you will be invited to this 20-30 minute non-technical interview.
This is your opportunity to convince us that you are a great fit for App Academy's immersive
program. Sell us on why you would thrive in our Bootcamp.

### What to Expect

Prepare for the non-tech interview as you would any job or school interview. Have answers to the obvious
background fit questions:

- Why are you interested in technology?
- Why are you pursuing software engineering in particular?
- Why do you want to attend App Academy among all other bootcamps?

Be prepared to answer the what, why, and when of your background:

- What schooling have you done previously?
- What jobs have you held?
- Can you explain any gaps in your education/work history?

When conversing over your background, don't just spit the facts. We already know the **what** and **when**
of your background from reading your resume alone. You need to connect the dots! **Why** did you major in X at
school, **why** did you work at X for 3 years, and **how** does that make you a great candidate for the
bootcamp? By attending a code bootcamp, you will be committing to a massive and sudden shift in your life. We
want to hear your story and understand what brought you to this point.

### Personal Pitch

The points above are topics you want to explore in the interview. The questions may not be asked directly by
your interviewer, but it's your job to paint the picture and explain why you are a strong fit.
For example, think about the classic open-ended interview question, "So tell me about yourself."
Your response to this will probably be the longest part of the conversation where you will be doing most of
the talking. Prepare a personal pitch you will use to respond to "tell me about yourself."

Some points you may want to cover in your pitch:

1. A brief (1min) overview of your past life. Where did you go to school, Where did you work, etc..
2. Why do you want to become a developer?
3. How will app academy help you achieve your goal? And why a/A specifically, compared other bootcamps?

Think of your personal pitch as a story describing how you made it to the bootcamp's doorstep.
Here's one example flow for a personal pitch.

Beginning:
> I attended college at [college name] university, majoring in [major] . After graduation I worked at [company]
as a [position]. During my time there, I accomplished [...] and learned how to [...].

Middle:
> I began tinkering with excel spreadsheets to automate some of my work which initially grew my interest in programming ...
after dabbling in some free programming resources I decided that I wanted a more structure/quicker way to learn, so I enrolled
into Bootcamp Prep...

End:
> Going through a/A Bootcamp Prep and programming everyday made me realize that I really enjoy programming and so I want to
continue to take my code to the next level at [bootcamp]. I think it's great that [bootcamp] does [...], so I'm excited to apply

Be sure to mention *specific* details in your pitch.

You **should** write down your personal pitch and rehearse it. Having this spiel ready to go will
show you are prepared and professional. It helps to jot down your talking points, but you don't have to
regurgitate your pitch verbatim during the interview. Write down your points as an exercise to see what you have
to work with. But mentally draw from the sections you see relevant over the course of the conversation.

When rehearsing your pitch and nontechnical conversations, here are a few things to be aware of:

+ Keep a natural flow
  + don't overuse filler words (um, like, so)
  + avoid reading off notes, have a human conversation
+ Be direct
  + keep your pitch between 2 - 3 minutes
+ Use a normal speaking pace
  + if you find yourself running out of breath, slow down
+ Bring positive energy and tone
+ Use body language appropriately
  + eye contact can show confidence
  + hand gestures can show you are passionate about what you are speaking about
  + nodding when listening to someone shows you are attentive
  + don't rest your head on your hands

### Common Conversation Questions

Think about how you would respond to the following questions in a Bootcamp Interview. **Ponder and write down your responses to
each of these questions.** You have plenty of time to think of your responses now, so don't brush off this task. On an interview,
you will be in the flow of a natural conversation so you want to avoid long pauses. These are general questions that may be
applicable to all bootcamps, not just App Academy.

* Tell me about yourself. What have you been up to in the last 2 years and what brought you to
the coding bootcamp scene?

* *Initial:* There are many great coding bootcamps out there. Why are you interested in App Academy in particular?
  * *Follow-Up:* Why do you think you will succeed at App Academy?

* *Initial:* Pair programming is a key aspect of App Academy's curriculum. What qualities do you think
make a good partner?
  * *Follow-Up:* Say you were paired up with an obviously shy/unresponsive partner, how would you get them to open up?

* *Initial:* App Academy requires a lot of stamina with a 100 hour per week commitment for 12+ weeks until you find a job. Have you been in an environment like this before?
  * *Follow-Up:* How would you stay motivated during the course?

* *Initial:* You've been programming quite a bit in Bootcamp Prep, what do you like about programming?
  * *Follow-Up:* What's your least favorite aspect of programming?

* *Initial:* Creating an inclusive environment is important to App Academy. What do diversity and inclusion mean to you?
  * *Follow-Up:* Many tech companies, not just bootcamps are focusing on diversity. Why do you think they value it?

### Do your Homework

A great way to show genuine interest in a bootcamp is by coming prepared. That means having your answers to the above questions
ready and your personal pitch rehearsed. Also be sure you have read up on the bootcamp you are interviewing for. If you are
applying to a school, know what they are about.
