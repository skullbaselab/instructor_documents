  The first few chapters have been released and we will continue releasing chapters as we complete them. Whenever you complete a chapter we’d like your feedback on the chapter. Feedback should be provided through a survey found at the end of each chapter (labeled “Feedback”). This is the most important thing for us because it’s what we will use to improve Bootcamp Prep Online for everyone using it.

  Thanks again for being a part of the development of Bootcamp Prep Online. Let’s get coding!

  Best,
