/* INSTRUCTIONS
//
// Welcome to your technical interview. Over the next 45 minutes, you
// will be given a series of three programming questions. For each question, you
// will have 15 minutes to write a solution in Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Perl,
// PHP, or Java. We accept partial solutions, and overall logic is more important
// to us than exact syntax, so try not to stress if your solution is incomplete
// or imperfect. Take a deep breath and focus on your approach to the next
// problem.
//
// Talk us through your approach as you work through the problem.  We need to know
// how you communicate the way that you solve problems.  Some people prefer to talk
// while they come to a solution, while other people prefer to walk us through
// after they've done a bit of work.  Either way is fine.
//
// We want to evaluate you on your own work, so the interview is closed-book. You
// are not permitted to consult any outside sources: don't ask others for help,
// search the web for solutions, or refer to any notes or code you may have
// written previously. Don't run your code in any REPL or interpreter, and don't
// share these questions or your solutions with anyone else (even anonymously).
// We take cheating very seriously, and violation is grounds for rejection or
// dismissal from the course.
//
// That said, you may ask your interviewer any questions you might have. We are
// more than happy to help clarify the question or let you know the right syntax
// for the language you're using.
//
// Good luck!
