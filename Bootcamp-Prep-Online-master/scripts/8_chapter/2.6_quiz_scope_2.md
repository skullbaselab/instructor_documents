Read the following code.

```js
var bar = 5;
console.log("1: " + bar); //1: What will bar be on this line?

function foo() {
  var bar = 10;
  console.log("3: " + bar); //3: What will bar be on this line?

  var innerFoo = function() {
    bar = 15;
  }

  console.log("4: " + bar); //4: What will bar be on this line?
}

console.log("2: " + bar); //2: What will bar be on this line?
foo();
console.log("5: " + bar); //5: What will bar be on this line?
```

1. What will be printed out when we first log `bar`(denoted by the `"1: "` prefix)?
2. What will be printed out on the second log of `bar`(denoted by the `"2: "` prefix)?
3. What will be printed out on the third log of `bar`(denoted by the `"3: "` prefix)?
4. What will be printed out on the fourth log of `bar`(denoted by the `"4: "` prefix)?
5. What will be printed out on the fifth log of  `bar`(denoted by the `"5: "` prefix)?

After you've made your logical guesses, download the file `scope1.js` and run it. Were your guesses correct? Why or why not?
