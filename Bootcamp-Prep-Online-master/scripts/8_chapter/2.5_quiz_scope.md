1. Read the following code. What will be printed out onto the screen when we log `foo`?

```js
var foo = 5;

function bar() {
  var foo = "Anthony";
  foo + " is home";
  return foo;
}


console.log(foo); // what is foo on this line?
```

  + `5`
  + `'Anthony'`
  + `'5 is home'`
  + `'Anthony is home'`
  + `undefined`

2. Read the following code. What will be printed out onto the screen when we log `bar()`?

```js
var foo = 5;

function bar() {
  var foo = "Anthony";
  foo + " is home";
  return foo;
}


console.log(bar()); // what does this print to the screen?
```

  + `5`
  + `'Anthony'`
  + `'5 is home'`
  + `'Anthony is home'`
  + `undefined`

3. Read the following code. What will be printed out onto the screen when we log `foo` (after `bar()`)?

```js
var foo = 5;

function bar() {
  var foo = "Anthony";
  foo + " is home";
  return foo;
}


bar();
console.log(foo); // what is foo on this line?
```

  + `5`
  + `'Anthony'`
  + `'5 is home'`
  + `'Anthony is home'`
  + `undefined`
