# Post-Course Supplemental Materials

We've developed a robust curriculum that includes several supplemental resources. Below is a description of these resources:

### Bootcamp Prep Live Lectures

These are a collection of all the lecture videos from the live course. The information is explained in a slightly different way and interspersed with questions. Watching these videos after completing the online course can be very beneficial for deepening your understanding. We **do not** recommend watching these videos before or while taking the online course because the information is presented in a different order and it could potentially be more confusing than helpful.

### Math Post-Course

Your math skills will play a huge role in defining how easy/difficult it is for you to understand key programming concepts. However, you need not memorize a bunch of mathematical formulas. Studying math trains your mind to think abstractly. The problems that you face in mathematics - having to solve some problem by executing a series of steps - is very similar to the types of problems you will face as a programmer. We have developed this math course to give you a basic understanding of certain mathematical principles that you will find valuable in your programming career. Not everything we teach you in this course will seem immediately applicable, but if you continue down the path of a software engineer, I promise you will see these ideas manifest again. We ask that you do this course after completing the online course because some of it relies on understanding some of the concepts discussed in class.
