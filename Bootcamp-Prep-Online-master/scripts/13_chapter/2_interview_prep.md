# How To Interview

One of the main goals of Bootcamp Prep Online is to turn you into a top bootcamp applicant. Now the best thing you can do in this endeavor is to become better at problem solving. However, interviewing skills can make a difference when it comes to getting admitted. In this lesson, we want to give you some principles on what makes a good interview:

### **MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION**

If there's one thing that my experience of interviewing hundreds of App Academy applicants has taught me, it's how vital it is that you understand the question you are solving. When we are under pressure, it becomes very easy to misread the prompt and start solving a question that wasn't asked. Interviewers will rarely stop you if you start answering the wrong question because (1) how are they suppose to know you misunderstood the question and (2) they may be testing your ability to clearly read the prompt.

Every time you interview, we want you do do a few things that'll guarantee you are answering the right question:
  1. Read the question out load.
  2. Look at the examples!

  Make sure the examples confirm your understanding of what's being asked. If you find an example that doesn't make sense according to how you are understanding the question, clarify with your interviewer. In addition, don't be afraid to ask for another example or to double check your understanding with a new example of your own.
  3. Even if you feel like you understand the question, reiterate the question to your interviewer anyway.

  You will never be punished for clarifying the prompt. In fact, most interviewers will see it as a good sign, that you are critically thinking about the question.

### **SPEAK UP**

You must be vocal. If you are soft-spoken or don't like talking while coding, this is a habit that you **must** break. Being vocal is necessary in order for your interviewer to understand your thought process. If you are quiet, your interviewer will most likely assume that you are completely lost and have no idea what you are doing. Even if you do get stuck, vocalizing your thoughts will convey that you are at least thinking about the problem and haven't given up.

*"But I'm really bad at talking through my code..."*, you might say. Luckily this is a skill that can be learned! But only if you are willing to put in the effort.

A good way to practice is to start talking out all of your code as you write it. From this point on, especially if you feel weak in this skill, I want you you talk out your code as you write. You've seen us do this throughout the course (e.g. solutions videos!), so you should have a basis on how to get started. Try using the correct vocabulary of programming as you speak. Don't worry if it's rocky at first; you'll get the hang of it as long as you keep at it.

### **STYLE MATTERS**

Style is very important. You must follow proper indentation guidelines, even during interviews where you may work in text editors that don't have automatic indentation for you. The main reason is because, in programming, style has a utility. It prevents an entire class of bugs that are due to mismatched curly brackets and makes your code more readable. Good style will also look good to your interviewer. When I interview students, I deduct points from their score if their code isn't readable, and that seems to be a common thing amongst my colleagues. Just because you are pressed for time, don't neglect style!

### **CALM DOWN**

Interviewing is stressful, and stress tends to make the mind go blank. Before you interview, try deep breathing, meditating, going on a walk, programming some small problems, whatever you have to do to slow down and calm down. At the same time, it's important to be able to work within stressful situations. Try timing yourself on a few CoderByte challenges or assessment problems. If you have a friend who program, try racing against them to solve problems. It's important to experience how it feels to code under stress so you know how to deal with it when you experience it during an interview.

### **THE MORE YOU INTERVIEW, THE BETTER YOU'LL BE AT INTERVIEWING**

We suggest interviewing at the bootcamps you are least excited about first. You'll find that the more you interview, the better you'll become at it. It is important that you reflect on your interview performance and realize the things you still need to study and improve for the next interview.
