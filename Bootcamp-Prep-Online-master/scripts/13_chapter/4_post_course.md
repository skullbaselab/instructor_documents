# Now that the course is over, what do I do?

Glad you asked! In order to continue learning and fully master the material covered, you may want to try a few of the things below:

1. Do the recitations if you haven't already.
2. Watch the classroom lectures.
3. Complete the math post-course.
4. Redo all the problem sets.
  * Then redo them again, but now time yourself. For example, 15 minutes per problem.
  * Then redo them again, but now time yourself and do them without testing using Node. Test only when you believe you've completed your solution. This will test whether or not you really understand your code and how the interpreter will behave when your code is run. In addition, this simulates a technical interview situation.
5. Retake the assessments. See if you can get complete it faster than before.
6. Sign up for your mock-interviews.
7. Complete more CoderByte problems.
8. Complete more Project Euler problems.
9. Look for other online resources and problems to solve.
10. Finally, notice that this isn't the last chapter. The final chapter teach you how to make JS classes. Although classes will not help you get into a bootcamp, they will deepen your knowledge of JavaScript.
