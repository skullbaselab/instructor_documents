# Decomposition

Decomposition is another very powerful technique of abstraction. It refers to the process of breaking down a large complex problem into smaller simpler problems. Breaking our problem down into smaller subproblems improves the reasonability and debug-ability of our programs.

Over the next three lectures, we are going to look at a specific example of decomposition and how it can drastically improve our understanding of our programs. We are going to look at a solution that is written in a single function and a solution that utilizes decomposition. The hope is that you'll see that the decomposed version is much easier to reason about and debug. I do want to warn you, the problem that we are going to look at is a tough one. While it may intimidate you and you may not fully understand the single-function solution, the purpose of this exercise is for you to see the value of decomposition.
