## `titleize`

Create a new JS file.

Write a function `titleize(title, stopWords)` that takes in a string `title`
and and array of strings `stopWords`. Return the `title` where every word that does not exist in the `stopWords` array is capitalized and every word in `stopWords` is lowercased.

Examples:
```javascript
>titleize("forest gump, the runner", ["the"])
"Forest Gump, the Runner"

>titleize("MASTER AND COMMANDER", ["and"])
"Master and Commander"

>titleize("i LOVE; lover of mine", ["love", "of"])
"I love; Lover of Mine"

>titleize("shall we dance?", ["dance"])
"Shall We dance?"
```

#### Guide
* First write a function `containsPunctuation(word)` that takes in a single word and returns `true` if the word contains a punctuation mark. Feel free to use the `punctuation` array we've given you below.

* Second, write a function `isStopWord(word, stopWords)` that takes in a single word and returns `true` if it is a stop word. The check will vary depending on if the `word` contains punctuation or not. Using `Array.prototype.indexOf` will not work in all cases. See the third example.

* Third, write the `titleize` function, using the functions you wrote before.
  - `"hey"[0]` returns a *copy* of `h`, not the original `h`, therefore:
    * `var myStr = "hey"`
    * `myStr[0] = "w"`
    * `myStr === "hey"`, not `"wey"`
  - Remember `Array.prototype.slice`? If not, revisit the lecture, look at the documentation and test it out in the console.

* Test after you write every function!

* Feel free to use this array in your solution:
```js
var punctuation = [";", "!", ".", "?", ",", "-"];
```
