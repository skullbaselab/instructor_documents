# Abstraction

Abstraction is a powerful technique we can use to manage the complexity of programs. Abstraction can be though of as the art of *hiding details*. What do we mean by this?

For example, when you're driving a car you interface with the steering wheel, gas and brake pedals, and the gear shift. You can use your car without having to understand how those components interact with each other or all of the numerous components you don't see (like the engine pistons). All of this has been *abstracted* away from the driver, so they can give as much attention to the task of driving as possible.

That is really why abstraction is so vital for the programmer; it allows us to focus our attention on a specific part of the program without getting lost in the details of the entire system. Abstraction is the art of hiding details. And over the next few lectures, we will go over two techniques of abstraction: good naming, creating functions, and decomposition.
