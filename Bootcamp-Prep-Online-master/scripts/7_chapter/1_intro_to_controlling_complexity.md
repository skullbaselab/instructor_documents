# Controlling Complexity

```
“When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued, made simple in its complexity.”
– Marijn Haverbeke, author of Eloquent JavaScript
```

Uncontrolled complexity is the arch-nemesis of a programmer. If we allow ourselves to write convoluted code and fail to fully understand our programs, we will inevitably introduce bugs. As programmers, we should always strive to write simple and correct code.

As we tackle more complex problems, our programs will grow in size and complexity. In this chapter, we will teach you techniques to help you master the complexity of your programs.
