## Primitive Data Types

Before we can start programming, which at its most basic involves manipulating data, we need to know what kinds of data we can manipulate. Programming languages all have built-in primitive data types. A *primitive data type* is the most basic building block provided by a programming language. JavaScript provides five primitive data types:

1. Boolean
2. `Null`
3. `Undefined`
4. Number
5. String

If you look up 'JavaScript primitive data types', you will see that there are actually six types specified by ECMAScript. The one missing from our list is Symbol. We will not be covering it because while it is in the ECMScript Standard, it has not been fully implemented.

We can group primitive data types into composite forms, but weâ€™ll save that for another lesson.
