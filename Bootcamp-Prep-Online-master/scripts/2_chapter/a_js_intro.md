## Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript was designed with the internet in mind. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at NetScape. If JavaScript is not your first programming language, you might notice some strange features about it. This is a consequence of it being created in only 10 days. Despite its peculiarities, JavaScript has matured into the main programming language of the internet.

In its infancy, JavaScript was taken to the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association, also known as ECMA, to be standardized. The resulting standard is called *ECMAScript* and JavaScript remains the most popular implementation of the ECMAScript Standard. Usually, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are used interchangeably and for our purposes, they refer to the same thing.

**NB**: Want to know the different between a standard and an implementation? While it's not vital to your understanding of JavaScript, click [here](../notes/standard_implementation.md) if you're curious.

JavaScript has been around for approximately two decades. It has matured and thrived over that time and is universally accepted as the standard web scripting language, supported by all browsers.

Developing in the browser involves understanding more than just JavaScript, but also HTML, CSS, and familiarity with the web ecosystem. *HTML* defines the structure of the content in a web page, while *CSS* defines how the content is styled. JavaScript’s role in the trio is to define the behavior of a web page.

### Node

A *runtime system* is an environment which allows you to execute programs written in a programming language.

**Node** is a JavaScript runtime system that allows us to execute JavaScript outside of the browser. Working in Node will allow us to focus purely on JavaScript and bypass a lot of the tangential knowledge required to work in the browser environment, like HTML or CSS.
