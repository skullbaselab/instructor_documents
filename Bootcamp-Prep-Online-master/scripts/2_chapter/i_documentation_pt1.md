## Navigating The Documentation

A vital skill that every programmer must acquire is learning how to effectively navigate the documentation.

The *documentation* of a language refers to the set of documents that explain how to use the language and all of its built-in functionality. We can find JavaScript's documentation in several locations on the internet; however, not all documentations are created equal. One of the best JavaScript documentations exists on [Mozilla Developer Network][MDN] or MDN.

To find MDN's JavaScript Documentation, I usually just do a quick search for "MDN JavaScript", and it's usually the first thing in the search results. In case you can't find it with a search, I've included a link to the documentation in the notes below.

Being able to navigate the documentation will be essential for your continual growth as a programmer. Let's take a look at some of the primitive data types we've discussed in the earlier lessons.

Under the 'Text processing' heading, click the link that says 'String'. We see that it leads to the documentation for the String constructor, which all instances of String inherit from.

This page contains a lot of information about strings. What is most important on this page is the listing of all the properties and methods that exists on each string.

This notation (`String.prototype.indexOf`) means that every instance of a String has a method called `indexOf`. Click it and it brings us to the documentation for that specific method.

At the top, we have a brief description of the method. Then we have an explanation of its syntax. Brackets denote optional parameters. Under the syntax we have a description of each parameter and what it means.

The rest of the page contains caveats and examples. I highly encourage you, only if you are serious about becoming a better JavaScript developer, to look at the documentation for each method we introduce you to.

One final note: You'll also notice that there are a bunch of methods that we did not introduce you to. Not everything in the documentation is standardized, and some of it may not work if you try it. So for now, only use the functions that we introduce in the course.
