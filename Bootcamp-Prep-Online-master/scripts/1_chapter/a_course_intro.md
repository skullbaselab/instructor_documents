## Welcome to Bootcamp Prep

Hello,

My name is Anthony. And I’d like to welcome you to App Academy’s Bootcamp Prep Program.

This course is fundamentally about using programming to solve problems, and our vehicle to explore this topic will be the JavaScript programming language. The goal is that by the end of the course you will have the skills to solve relatively complex problems, have an intermediate understanding of JavaScript and the confidence to explore new topics on your own, and, of course, turn you into a prime bootcamp applicant.

The reason we chose JavaScript as our vehicle for understanding problem solving is because one, it is the most widely used language in the world. JavaScript is undisputedly the language of the internet and the internet has become an ubiquitous tool for communication. Secondly, every bootcamp will let you go through their application process using JavaScript. Most bootcamps are not looking for whether or not you are using the “right” programming language, but rather, if you have the ability to solve problems methodically and intelligently, which is why we’ve decided to center this course on just that.

See you in class.
