# What is Programming?

Programming is the process of developing a set of instructions that automate
performing a specific task. The instructions are
written in a programming language and executed by a computer.

A programming language is a formal, constructed language designed to communicate
instructions to a computer. Learning a programming language is not that different
from learning a natural language (eg. English, Spanish, or Chinese). When
describing a language, programming or natural, we can think about it in two
ways: *syntactically* and *semantically*.

The **syntax** of a language refers to how its symbols are structured into valid
statements and expressions. For example, in English it is syntactically invalid
to say : “Going store to the am I”. All of the words in this sentence are valid,
but the way I’ve structure them together is not. A correct use of syntax would
be “I am going to the store”.

The **semantics** of a language refers to the meaning of those symbols. It is
possible for a statement to be syntactically correct, but semantically
incorrect. For example, “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously”. Although this
statement is grammatically and syntactically correct, it has no real meaning.
The semantics of this statement are invalid.

When learning a new language, one of the first steps is to get an understanding
of its syntax and semantics, and in that spirit, the next module will be
dedicated to learning JavaScript syntax and semantics. In other words,
you’ll learn the meaning of various symbols and keywords used in JavaScript,
and how to structure them in a valid way.
