## How to Install Node

Before we can get started programming in JavaScript, we must first setup an environment that can read our JavaScript commands and do something with them. In other words, we need a tool to run our JavaScript programs.

#### Node.js
Node.js is a very powerful runtime environment built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites, robots, and other general purpose applications. What this really means for us is that Node provides a way for us to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

#### Download Node

In order to get started with Node, go to www.nodejs.org and download the most stable version for your operating machine.

Once you have it successfully installed, try typing `node -v` in your Terminal/Command Prompt. (Terminal for Macs and Command Prompt for PCs). This should return your node version. Next, try typing `node`, this should open the Node REPL environment.

REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print Loop. When we are working in a REPL, every time we press the enter button, the computer reads what we typed, evaluates it, and prints the evaluation.

Now that you’ve successfully installed Node, you’re almost ready to start programming! But first a quiz.
