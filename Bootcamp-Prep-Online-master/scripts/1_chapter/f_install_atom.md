## How to Install Atom

Now that you have JavaScript environment ready, let’s set up your text editor, or IDE.

An **IDE** stands for Interactive Development Environment. It is a type of text editing software used by programmers to write their coding files, also known as scripts. It is where the code is actually written. IDEs come in all forms and with different functionalities. Some are small and simple, while others offer broad and complex functionality. Most IDEs will provide syntax highlighting, autocomplete and keyboard shortcuts.

#### Atom
If you already have a favorite IDE, feel free to use that during the course.

We’ll be using Atom. It’s free, easy-to-use, robust and has a vast library of plugins.


#### Download Atom
