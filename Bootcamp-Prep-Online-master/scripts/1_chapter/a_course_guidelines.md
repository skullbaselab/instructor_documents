## Course Guidelines

Hey, welcome to Bootcamp Prep! My name is Winnie and I'll be one of the instructors.

Before we get started, let's talk about how to get the most out of this course. Bootcamp Prep is broken up into chapters, with each chapter containing a combination of:
+ video lectures
+ short quizzes
+ problem sets

Some of these chapters will also be assessments.

When watching our lectures, we highly encourage you to code alongside with us. A degree of memorization will be required to succeed. But as with anything else in life, practice makes perfect. Simply watching the lecture will not be enough to make you a great programmer. Follow along during the lecture and repeat exercises again after. If you don't fully understand the material covered in a lecture video, continue with the chapter and then return to the lectures you had trouble with.
Short quizzes will test you on your understanding of the lecture material. They will typically consists of multiple choice questions. If you arrive at a quiz and don't understand the logic behind an answer, be sure to review the lecture.

You'll download and complete problem sets on your own. They'll contain coding exercises. Always check your answers by watching our solution videos. You should redo any questions you get wrong. Make sure you aren't only understanding the concepts, but are also paying attention to how we style and format our code. Proper style is very important for preventing bugs and is something you should also be looking at when looking at the solutions. At the very beginning at least, your final solutions should look exactly like our solutions.

Assessments will happen at key points of the curriculum. Attempt to do them in the given time. As with problem sets, check your answers. After you check the solutions, redo your assessment until you get a perfect score.

Lastly, whether it's code from lecture videos, problem sets, assessments or solutions, don't just copy and paste the code. Please don't skip over the work of actually typing out the code. It will be tough and potentially frustrating in the beginning. You will make a lot of mistakes. It's really ok. It's a necessary and unavoidable phase to go through. Typing out the code will give you a muscle memory that simply listening to videos won't give. There's no better way to learn how to code than to actually code.

With all of that said, let's get started!
