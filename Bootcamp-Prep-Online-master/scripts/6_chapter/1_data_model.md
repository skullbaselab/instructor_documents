# Data Modeling

What is meant by the term "data modeling"? Let's break it down. "Data" refers to all of the primitive data types and composite data structures that we've learned so far. Let's remind ourselves of all the types of data we know about:

* Primitive Data Types
  * Strings
  * Numbers
  * Booleans
  * Undefined
  * Null
* Composite Data Structures
  * Arrays
  * Objects

*Data Modeling* refers to the act of structuring and organizing data in a way that is useful for solving the task at hand. Sometimes we will be given data that is structured in a certain way and our task as the programmer will be to write functions that are able to correctly parse that data. In other cases, we may have to analyze the behavior of functions and create data models that can be used by that function.

In this chapter, we will complete two exercises that will help us develop these skills.
