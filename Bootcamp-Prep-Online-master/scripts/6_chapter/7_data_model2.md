Download the file `dataModel2.js`.

For this exercise, you will create complex objects that are meant to be parsed by specified functions. Your task will be to analyze the function and structure your objects in a way so you get the appropriate output. Over the next two lectures, we will complete the two problems together. You will attempt the final problem on your own.

Once you've downloaded the file, take a look at it, then go to the next lecture!
