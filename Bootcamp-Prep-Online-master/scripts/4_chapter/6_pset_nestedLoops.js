Write a function `divisibleByThreePairSum(array)` that takes
an array of numbers. It should return an array of all the
pairs of indices whose sum is a multiple of three.

Examples:
> divisibleByThreePairSum([1, 6, 3, 4, 2, 0]);
[[0, 4], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4]]

> divisibleByThreePairSum([8, 3, 5, 9, 2]);
[[1, 3]]

/*************************************************************
Write a function `peakFinder(array)` that takes in an array of
numbers. It should return an array containing the indices of
all the peaks. A peak is an element that is greater than both
of its neighbors. If it is the first or last element, it is
a peak if it is greater than its one neighbor. Assume the
array has a length of at least 2. Writing this function does
not require a nested loop.

Examples:
> peakFinder([1,2,3,2,1])
[2]

> peakFinder([2,1,2,3,4,5])
[0, 5]

> peakFinder([4,6,9,4,2,-7,2,-4,5])
[2, 6, 8]
