## Responding to Fulltime Application Questions

Since most students have the goal of getting accepted into an immersive
bootcamp program after Bootcamp Prep, they will occasionally have questions about the logistics of
the application process. As an instructor of Bootcamp Prep,
you can use this document to answer their questions as best as you can. **Only use the information
in this document to respond to their questions. If you receive a question that you cannot answer
using the info in this doc, do not make any guesses - tell the student you do not have that information
and forward the question to the Bootcamp Prep Manager.**

### Why is it important?

Most students take our Bootcamp Prep with the goal of gaining acceptance into App Academy, not the other bootcamps on our
guarantee list. As teachers, their goal is also ours - but here's the reality: taking Bootcamp Prep raises the admissions rate
into App Academy from 3% to 55% (as of Jan 2018). This means that half of our students will not be accepted into App Academy.
Furthermore, students may be rejected by some bootcamps on the guarantee list. Because of this, it is imperative that we properly
**manage the expectations of our students**.

As you interact with students, you will naturally formulate opinions on which students will be accepted into top bootcamps and
which are not ready for top bootcamps. No matter what mental predictions you make, keep them to yourself. At no point should you
tell a student "I think you'll be accepted at X Bootcamp." If a student is rejected from a bootcamp after an instructor tells
them they "will or should" get into that bootcamp, the disappointment will be huge. The student may question our expertise if the
prediction is wrong and exit the course feeling cheated. Even if they get perfect scores on every assessment and are an amazing
pair, we are no place to make any admissions predictions for a/A or any other bootcamps, so avoid doing so.

This will be a hard topic to avoid. As a teacher, you'll feel the tendency to give your students that vote of confidence,
especially if you feel they deserve to go to X bootcamp. To be clear, you *should* answer students' question about their overall
performance in the course and what things they need to improve. However, don't indicate any conclusion on which bootcamps you
think they will be accepted into (App Academy included). **Bootcamp admission decisions are complex and unpredictable, so avoid
giving students false hope that may lead to disappointment.**

### Common Student Questions and Appropriate Responses:

**Question: "When is the deadline to get into the -date- a/A fulltime cohort?"**

Answer: It varies due to availability of seating. Typically a student must be accepted at least 4-6 weeks
before the cohort start date, but a cohort can reach capacity sooner if demand is high. The student should contact
admissions@appacademy.io for the latest cohort availability statuses. Recommend the student to not rush into an
interview just to make a certain cohort date. If the interview doesn't pan out well, they may be rejected
and not be able to attend any cohort. Advise them to apply when *they* feel confident in their interview skills.

**Question: "If my interviews don't go well, can I do a retake?"**

Answer: Advise students to treat their interview as their only opportunity to get into the bootcamp. If their interview
performance is not favorable, they may be rejected and never be able to reapply to that bootcamp. Empathize with the student. Admit that it sounds stressful, but tell them if they really want to get into a particular bootcamp, they must
treat it as their one shot and study as hard as possible.

**Question: "I finished my technical interview and was invited to a nontechnical interview, does this mean I'm in?!?"**

Answer: The student is not in the clear yet, they still must pass the non-tech interview to see if they are a good fit for
the bootcamp. Advise the student to not take it lightly. Use the nontechnical interview notes in the curriculum to prepare for
the conversation and have some talking points ready. Like any school/job interview, they should put their best foot forward in
the nontech interview

**Question: "I finished an interview with -bootcamp name- ... Do you think I will be accepted?"**

Answer: Your students may often reach out to you after completing interviews (for a/A and other bootcamps), telling you about their experience. The students will often ask your opinion on whether or not they will be accepted based on the performance they
described. **You should not provide any opinion on this.** An admissions decision is very complex with many elements
factoring in, so you should avoid making any assumptions. Even if you personally think that the student is a great fit for a
bootcamp based on your experience with them, refrain from giving them an unofficial admission decision. This is especially
relevant when students interview for App Academy. It will be disastrous if an a/A instructor tells a student that they should be
accepted, only to later be rejected from a/A.

### Applying and Skipping the Coding Challenge

After students graduate from the course, they can apply to App Academy through the usual form
on our website, [appacademy.io][app-academy-app]. **When applying to the immersive course they
should use the same email address they enrolled into Bootcamp Prep.** Graduates of Bootcamp
Prep will be able to skip the initial coding challenge and go straight into scheduling their
technical interviews.

Students who have previously begun an application to the immersive course before Bootcamp Prep
will receive an automated email inviting them to continue their application by scheduling
their technical interview.

In either case, students will only be able to schedule their technical interview once they reach
graduate status at the end of the course. Otherwise, they will not have the benefit of skipping
the coding challenge.

### Making Recommendations

Since you yourself are a graduate of App Academy, you once were in a similar situation when applying to a/A.
Feel free to offer advice or strategy that you used when applying to bootcamps. How did you prepare? How did you
plan? What was the interview like? Be empathetic! Students love it when you give them honest feedback based on 
your own experience, but be conscious of the things mentioned above.
