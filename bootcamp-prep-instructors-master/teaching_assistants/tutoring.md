## Bootcamp Prep Online Tutoring

As Bootcamp Online TA it is your responsibility to provide tutoring sessions to the students. Since the course is self-paced and online, tutoring is where students
get the opportunity to learn face-to-face with an instructor. Since the online
students have limited exposure to live instruction, it is important to provide
the best experience possible during their sessions! Teaching is an enormous responsibility and one that we do not give you lightly. You have been selected not only for your technical skills, but also for your ability to teach and take on this responsibility. **It is important to be empathetic, invested, and honest!**

### Be Positive; Be Empathetic

You'll be representing App Academy, so put your best foot forward. Smile and be
friendly. Being positive this way will put students at ease so they can focus on
the material at hand. Most of the students in Bootcamp Prep have little to no programming experience. Because programming as beginner is difficult, some students will feel very stressed out and unconfident in their ability to become a great programmer. It is important
that you keep this in mind every time you interact with a student. Always emphasize
to your students that is normal to find the material hard, and that mastery will
come with time and practice.

Be as open and friendly as you can be, so students don't hesitate to ask you
questions.

### Logistics

Tutoring sessions are an hour long. You may use combination of [codeshare][codeshare], [repl.it][repl-it],
and Skype.

+ Skype is for voice/video/screen-sharing. Please have your webcam on to make the session more
personal. However, don't require the student to turn on theirs.
+ Codeshare is used for "pairing up" with the student so both can edit code. Codeshare has
no feature to execute code. If you would like to demo how code would execute, share your screen on skype
and use a repl.it session.

When a student schedules a session, they will specify which topics they would like to cover.
It is important that you take note of these topics so you know what to expect during
the session. The direction of a session can change, so be ready to adjust as well. Feel free to
direct a session to a particular topic if you sense gaps in their knowledge. Follow your teaching instincts!
