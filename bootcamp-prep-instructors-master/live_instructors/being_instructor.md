## Being Instructor

**As an instructor, you are responsible for the success of your students.**
This is an enormous responsibility and one that we do not give you lightly.
You have been selected not only for your technical skills, but also for your ability
to teach and take on this responsibility. **It is more important to be empathetic, invested, and honest**
than it is to be an expert at JavaScript as an instructor of Bootcamp Prep.

### Be Positive; Be Empathetic

Most of the students in Bootcamp Prep have little to no programming experience.
Because programming as beginner is difficult, some students will feel very stressed
out and unconfident in their ability to become a great programmer. It is important
that you keep this in mind every time you interact with a student. Always emphasize
to your students that is normal to find the material hard, and that mastery will
come with time and practice.

Be as open and friendly as you can be, so students don't hesitate to ask you questions.

### Teaching Techniques

+ **Set high standards for yourself and the students.** Most of the
students are new to software, and they don't know what good code looks
like. They should be held to the standard of a professional, or else
they will never get there; it is never too early in the course to
*demand* this of them.

+ **Start enforcing style guidelines on the first day**.
Give honest feedback and make it clear that you believe they can meet the
standards you set. And then help them meet those standards. Never let students push
off styling their code properly. Do not let them put off fixing poor variable naming,
convoluted logic, bad code style, etc.

+ Many students will be focused solely on finishing the exercise that
they are working on, without any care as to code quality. It bears
repeating to students: **any software engineer worth their salt can
make a solution work. The mark of a great software engineer is high
quality code.** Good style an indentation will be free points on a bootcamp interview.
It shows that a candidate has had previous experiencing creating high quality code.

+ **Do not ever just give the student an answer**; help them figure out what
they needed to know to get to the answer. When they run into a bug,
spend time asking them how their code works. The best way to answer questions is
to ask more questions yourself. A common technique is to pull up the Node REPL
and have them work through explanatory examples with you. Avoid giving them the
solution to their bug or problem. When wrapping up with a student ask them, "Does that
make sense?" or have them recap what you did together.

+ A final note: **students appreciate your honesty**. They want to
understand things deeply. They like it when you spend time struggling
with them. Don't be afraid to admit when you don't know something.
Either tell them it's beyond the scope of the course and/or follow-up on Piazza
or the next day with an answer. **Honest feedback is essential and valued**.

### Helping the Weaker Students

We need to keep a close pulse on the progress of each student and ensure that we
target our efforts to those students that need and can benefit from it most.

Students break down into four categories:

* Students who could show up every day and get into the best bootcamps without our help.
* Students who are strong but need to be occasionally unstuck.
* Students who will struggle through the class, but will improve because they ask questions.
* Students who will struggle through the class and hardly improve because they **won't** ask questions or study outside of class.

Our goal is to get as many people into bootcamps as possible after the class;
therefore, **let the best students be**. Do not overly focus on them because they
are the easiest to work with, or because you can do cooler stuff with them.
**Your job is to save people who are on the edge**.

It is important to **identify the weaker students**; they need your
help. Focus on them. Roughly 2/3's of your time should be spent with
the weaker students. The assessment scores can be super helpful in keeping
a pulse on the class.
