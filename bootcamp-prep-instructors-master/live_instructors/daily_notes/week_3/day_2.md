## Week 2 Day 3

### Primary Goals

- Students should understand
  - what scope is and how it effects our code
  - the difference between local and global scope
  - the importance of the `var` keyword
  - JS scope rules
    - a function has it's own scope
    - an inner scope **can** access variables in the surrounding outer scope
    - an outer scope **cannot** access variables in an inner scope
  - that JavaScript has function scope

### Logistics

- Do plenty of examples of scope during lecture
- Test the class about their understanding frequently by asking them to predict
what certain variables will print out
- The first part of the problem set is about predicting what variables will evaluate
to according to scoping rules; do one of them as a class
