## Week 3 Day 4

### Primary Goals

- Students should understand
  - how to navigate through complex data like an array filled with objects
  - what makes a good technical interview
  - how important communication is on a technical interview

### Logistics

- Today is a two part lecture, Data Modeling and Interview Tips.
- Data Modeling
  - Work through all of the `data_model1` exercises as a class.
  - Do the first `data_model2` exercise as a class.
  - Save the rest of the `data_model2` exercises for them to complete as part of problem set time
- Interview Tips
  - Feel free to give your students some anecdotal insight into what the App Academy
  interview is like. Most of the students have a/A as their first choice, so they
  are always eager to get any info they can on the process.
  - Stress how important pairing/communication is on an interview and why it is so
  important in App Academy's full-time immersive course.
- For problem set time have them work on the remainder of `data_model2`
  - there is also a regular problem set available
