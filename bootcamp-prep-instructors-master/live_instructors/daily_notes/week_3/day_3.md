## Week 3 Day 3

### Primary Goals

- Students should understand
  - that the `Math` object contains useful methods
  - how to use [MDN][mdn] for documentation
  - how to use callbacks and why they are useful
  - understand some built-in higher order functions like `Array.prototype.map` and
  `Array.prototype.forEach`

### Logistics

- Show them a few methods from the math object
  - show them how to use the [MDN][mdn] documentation to look up methods
  - solve a simple problem that uses math methods, like finding area of a circle
  of a given radius
- Most of lecture time should be spent on callbacks. Callbacks are difficult for new
programmers to grasp
- Stress that a callback behaves just like a regular function. Callbacks can return,
take arguments, etc..
- As you work through callback examples, avoid using anonymous function as this will
cause additional confusion. You should pass in callbacks by name.
