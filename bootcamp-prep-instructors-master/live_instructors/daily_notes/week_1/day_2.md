## Week 1 Day 2

### Primary Goals:

- Students should
  - know how to write functions
  - know the difference between a function definition and call
  - know how a function call is evaluated with arguments
  - know about proper variable naming
  - know what a return value is and how it can be useful
  - know the difference between `return` and `console.log`

### Logistics:

- Be sure to step through how a function call is evaluated frequently
- Gather the class's attention when explaining how a function is evaluated by telling them to look up from their computers
- Give them motivation as to why functions and return values are useful
- Do the first problem set function as a class. Teach them how to interpret the question and examples
- Have them work on the problem set solo, be available to help them
