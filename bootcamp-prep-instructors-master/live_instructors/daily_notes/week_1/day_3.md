## Week 1 Day 3

### Primary Goals:

- Students should
  - know how to write `while` and `for` loops with correct syntax
  - understand how a loop is executed
  - understand how an infinite loop is formed
  - know how to manipulate the counter/condition/incrementer of a loop to iterate
  in different ways

### Logistics:

- Cover examples that iterate in different ways. For example: iterating through
decreasing numbers, skipping numbers, etc..
- Show them an example of a loop with a conditional inside of it
- Translate one of your `for` loop examples into a `while` loop so students see
that they are interchangeable
- Have them work on the problem set in pairs. From this point on, the problem students
will be paired
