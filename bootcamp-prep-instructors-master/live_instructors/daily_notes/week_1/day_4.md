## Week 1 Day 4

### Primary Goals:

- Students should
  - know how to use arrays and basic array methods
  - know how to use `indexOf` on an array
  - know how to iterate through an array
  - understand the workflow of an assessment

### Logistics:

- Work methodically through how iterating through an array with a loop works
- Be sure to save time in class to work through some of the practice assessment as a class.
  - show them how to set up their environment
  - emphasize how the students can check their work using mocha
  - there are a few array problems inside, feel free to use those to drill in arrays
