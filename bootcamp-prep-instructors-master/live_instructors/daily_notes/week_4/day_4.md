## Week 4 Day 4

This day is a bit different so be sure to read this through!

### Primary Goals
- Take Assessment 7
- Students should understand next steps to take after prep:
  - post course study
  - applying to App Academy
  - schedule mock interviews
  - etc..
- Give students insight into life in App Academy's full immersive bootcamp

### Logistics
- Administer Assessment 7 from 6:30 - 7:30.
- No need to review any assessment problems, go straight into lecture
- For lecture, go over the points in the `what's_next` file.
  - Encourage your students to continue studying after prep. To have the best
  shot of getting into App Academy, they should feel comfortable solving all the
  problems from the course.
- On this second to last day, open the floor for the students to ask questions
about what life is like inside of a a/A's full course. We have discussed things
like a the layout of a typical day, assessments, pairing, job search etc.. If you
or your TA are graduates from the full course, feel free to answer their questions
given your experiences. Do this Q/A until time is up, if it finished early, have
them do the problem set.
- Tell students that there is a final assessment tomorrow where they may not ask for help
from the TAs.
