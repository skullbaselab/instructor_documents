## Week 4 Day 2

### Primary Goals
- Students should
  - understand what makes a good driver/navigator pair
  - gain exposure pairing as drivers and navigators

### Logistics
- No new material today, besides a lecture on how to driver/navigator pair
- Start out by going over yesterday's problem set
- For lecture, go over the pairing guidelines.
- Students should spend most of the day pairing for the problem set
- To motivate your students, emphasize that there **will** be a similar pairing
  portion of the App Academy's technical interview
- Feel free to talk about how pairing in this way is core aspect of App Academy's
immersive course and how beneficial it is
- As the students are pairing be sure to walk around and monitor them. Be available
to nudge them if they get stuck as well.
