## Week 4 Day 3

### Primary Goals
- Students should
  - have a basic grasp of how recursion works
  - understand the purpose of a base case
- Students should get more exposure to driver/navigator pairing

### Logistics
- Review the problems from yesterday's problem set.
- Today's lecture will be a beginner intro to recursion. Emphasize that it is
an advance topic that will be explored in-depth in the full bootcamp
  - You should cover the points in the notes, but it is up to you how much deeper
  you want to explore recursion with your class aside from the notes.
  - You may lose the students' understanding at `factorial`. This is okay,
  if they understand up to `countDown` then they are in good shape!
  - If you sense they are keeping up, blow minds with recursive fibonacci for fun
- Students should be in new driver/navigator pairs for today's problem set!
