## Week 4 Day 1

This Monday is a bit different, so be sure to read this through!

### Primary Goals

- Take assessment 6
- Students should understand what to expect for a nontechnical interview and how to prepare.

### Logistics

- Start the assessment first thing at 6:30.
- Be available to answer questions during the assessment. If you a see a student totally
struggling, walk them through a problem.
- Have the students upload their assessment at 7:30.
- No need to do assessment review in class today.

- In the second half of class, talk about the what a nontechnical bootcamp interview is like by referring to the
`nontechnical_interview_tips` in the day's notes folder.
- Feel free to talk about your own anecdotal experience in nontechnical/fit interviews (especially the one you had for a/A)
- Emphasize what non-tech qualities a/A is looking for.
- Have the students pair up and give each other practice interviews by following the `practice_conversation` doc in the notes.
- Once the students finish their conversations, have them work pair through the regular `problem_set`.
