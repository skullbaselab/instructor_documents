## Week 2 Day 2

### Primary Goals

- Students should
  - understand why it is beneficial to decompose complex problems
  - know how to declare objects
  - know how to access values using dot and bracket notation
  - know the difference between dot and bracket notation
  - know how to iterate through an object
  - know that we need the *key* to access the *value* of an object
  - understand what a method of an object is

### Logistics
- Start out by going over the controlling_complexity notes
  - go over one example of decomposing a problem into a helper function,
  but most of lecture time should be spent on objects
- Highlight similarities and differences between arrays and objects.
  - Arrays contains elements, Objects contain key-value pairs
  - Arrays are ordered, objects are unordered
  - etc..
- Show them how a variable containing a string can only be used as a key on an object
with brackets and not a dot.
