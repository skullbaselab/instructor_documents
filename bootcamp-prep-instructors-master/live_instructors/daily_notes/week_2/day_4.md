## Week 2 Day 4

### Primary Goals

- students should
  - understand the similarities and differences between strings and arrays
  - know that strings are immutable
  - understand the importance of good style and indentation
  - understand how to read a stack trace
  - understand the different types of common JS errors
    - ReferenceError
    - TypeError
    - SyntaxError
  - understand that `console.log` is very powerful when used to debug

### Logistics

- There are a few different topics to cover today. Start lecture with strings vs arrays
and style. Covering debugging as the last topic. Most of lecture time should be spent
on debugging.
- Stress that programmers at all levels experience bugs. The majority of their time will
be spent fixing bugs, so they should not get frustrated when one pops up.
- Feel free to cover debugging however you like.
- For my debugging lecture, I use a piece of code we have worked on previously,
like the `firstNPrimes` function, as an example. During lecture we break the code
in particular ways and step through the process we can take to figure out the issue.
- When going through debugging examples, be methodical, as if you were really
trying to figure out the bug. Start by interpreting the output of the code, tracing
the control flow, and using `console.log` on variables
