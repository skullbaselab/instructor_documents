## Week 2 Day 3

### Primary Goals

- Students should
  - know how to write nested loops and understand how they iterate
  - understand that an element of an array can be any data, including another array
  - understand how to iterate through a 2D array using nested loops


### Logistics

- Start by going over yesterday's problem set. It is common for students to struggle
 with yesterday's objects, so clarify any remaining questions they have. Go slow as
 you review the object problem set.
- Code a few different examples with nested loops, showing
  - a nested loop that doesn't have to do with arrays
  - a nested loop that prints all pairs of elements in an single array
    - show how  to prevent duplicate pairs
  - a nested loop that iterates through a 2D array
- In the night's homework there are additional readings and videos about test driven development for Hack Reactor
