## Daily Instruction

### 15 minutes before and after class

Class is officially from 6:30pm - 9:00pm and students are required to be present
during this time. However, you should be available 15 minutes before and after
class to set up/break down the room and take any questions from students. These extra times are a great opportunity to give students
1 on 1 attention. This extra time is not mandatory for students to attend,
but make it clear that you are available for them.

### Class start and problem review

Take attendance in the spreadsheet by marking an `x` for students that are present.
Begin lecture at 6:30pm. Lecture should begin with a review of
the previous day's problem set. You do not need to go over every single problem.
Ask the class which problems they would like to go over and solve them together.
If the class does not have any questions, select a few problems and go over them anyways.
Be sure to hit the tricky problems especially!

As you go over the problems, you may notice students struggling with parts of the
material. Take the opportunity to spot check their understanding by doing a brief
review. It is important to keep their understanding up to date, so be thorough with
this review. New material will be presented almost everyday. If students carry over
large deficits from day to day, they may be very lost moving forward.

### Lecture

On most days there will be a lecture. Read the markdown files in the notes folder
for the day. You do not have to cover these notes verbatim (feel free to use your own
examples, etc.), but you should cover all of the concepts in these notes. Lecture
time ranges depending on the day's topic and the questions. Some lectures may be
be half an hour, others can be an hour and a half.

Be sure to pause frequently, especially after writing a few lines of code. Ask the class
if they have any questions. Be prepared to entertain their questions. If you feel
a student's question is not relevant or too advance, let them know and cover that
question 1 on 1 with the student after class.

Make lecture active by having students participate. Pose questions. Ask them to predict how code will behave, what method to use, etc..

### Problem Set and Pairing

On most days there will be time for students to work on problems in the `problems` folder
for the day. This time is a great opportunity to give students 1-on-1 attention.
Be available to answer the students questions. Some students may be too shy to ask
for help. You should be proactive. Walk around the room occasionally and peek at the
student's work. If you see someone struggling greatly, lend them a hand.

Except for the first two days, students should be working on the problem set in pairs.
You should choose designated pairs for the day. It is important that you designate
pairs as students will gravitate toward only those they are familiar with and some
students may feel excluded. It is also important to give students practice in
collaborating with strangers over code. As the course progresses, you will
have a feel for who is technically strong and weak, so avoid pairing two very
weak students.

### Wrapping Up Class

Class officially ends at 9:00, but students are welcome to continue working until
9:15pm. At 9:00 you should give a short announcement of the end of class, recapping
what was learned that day, and giving a nod of what's going on tomorrow. Encourage
your student's to finish the problem set at home. Also, **let them know that they must
fill out the night's feedback on progress tracker before they leave**. Here's an example of a
wrap-up announcement for week 1 day 4.

> Alright everyone, that's a wrap on day 4! It's 9:00, but feel free to work
until 9:15. Great pair work today with arrays. I heard some great technical conversations
around the room! It's okay if you are finding arrays difficult right now,
mastery will come with time! Work on these problems as much as you can. Don't
forget that tomorrow we will have our first assessment the after some review.
So be sure to come in with any questions you have. Please don't forget to fill out
your feedback forms, before you leave. Thanks!

#### Upload Your Lecture Notes After Class

After a session, you or the TA should share the notes you built during lecture with your students.
This is important as students may not be able to copy everything down during the lecture.
Upload the your lecture notes to your class's slack channel. Name them `city_dayNumber.js`,
for example `SF_w1d2.js`. Advise your students to view your notes as well as the notes in the GitHub repo.
